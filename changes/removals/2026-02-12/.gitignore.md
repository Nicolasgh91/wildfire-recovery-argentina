# Removal log: .gitignore
Date: 2026-02-12

Removed:
```
lib/
lib64/
```

Reason:
These global ignores prevented `frontend/src/lib` from being tracked in Git, which caused missing imports after clone.

Recovery:
If you need the previous behavior, restore the lines above to `.gitignore` and remove the `/lib/` and `/lib64/` rules.
