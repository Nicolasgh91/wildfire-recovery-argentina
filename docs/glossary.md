# 📚 ForestGuard Glossary

This document defines key technical terms, remote sensing concepts, and domain-specific terminology used throughout the ForestGuard platform.

## 🛰️ Remote sensing & data sources

### NASA FIRMS
**Fire Information for Resource Management System**. A NASA program that distributes near real-time fire data from MODIS and VIIRS sensors.
- **Used for**: Initial detection of thermal anomalies (hotspots).

### VIIRS
**Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite**. A sensor aboard the Suomi NPP and NOAA-20 satellites.
- **Resolution**: 375m (high resolution).
- **Advantage**: Better at detecting smaller fires than MODIS.

### MODIS
**Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer**. A key instrument aboard the Terra and Aqua satellites.
- **Resolution**: 1km.
- **Advantage**: Long historical record (since 2000).

### Sentinel-2
A wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission from the ESA (European Space Agency) Copernicus programme.
- **Resolution**: 10m - 20m.
- **Used for**: Detailed vegetation analysis, burn scar mapping, and land use classification.
- **Revisit Time**: ~5 days.

### GEE (Google Earth Engine)
A cloud-based geospatial analysis platform that enables analyzing satellite imagery at a planetary scale.
- **Role**: Performs server-side calculations of NDVI and image processing without downloading massive datasets.

### NDVI
**Normalized Difference Vegetation Index**. A metric used to quantify vegetation health and density.
- **Formula**: `(NIR - Red) / (NIR + Red)`
- **Range**: -1 to +1.
  - `> 0.5`: Healthy/Dense vegetation.
  - `0.1 - 0.2`: Bare soil.
  - `< 0`: Water or non-vegetated.
- **Usage**: Monitoring post-fire recovery and detecting illegal clearing.

## 🏗️ Technical architecture

### PostGIS
A spatial database extender for PostgreSQL.
- **Role**: Stores all geospatial data (fire events, protected areas) and performs spatial queries (e.g., "Find all fires within 500m of this point").

### Cloudflare R2
S3-compatible object storage service by Cloudflare.
- **Role**: Stores generated artifacts like map thumbnails, PDF reports, and certificates.
- **Advantage**: Zero egress fees (free bandwidth).

### Redis
An in-memory data structure store.
- **Role**: Acts as a message broker for Celery, managing queues for asynchronous background tasks (e.g., "download_imagery").

### Celery
A distributed task queue for Python.
- **Role**: Handles heavy background processes (ingestion, image analysis) to keep the API fast and responsive.

### H3
A hexagonal hierarchical geospatial indexing system.
- **Role**: Used to cluster fire detections into meaningful "Fire Events" based on spatial proximity.

## 🌲 Domain concepts

### Fire event
A consolidated entity representing a wildfire, derived from clustering multiple individual satellite detections (hotspots) over space and time. Unlike a raw detection, a "Fire Event" has a start date, end date, estimated area, and total duration.

### Land use audit (UC-01)
A formal verification process to check if a specific plot of land intersects with historical fire events. Used by legal professionals to determine if "fire prohibitions" (Ley de Manejo del Fuego) apply to a property.

### VAE (Vegetation Analysis Engine)
An internal worker service responsible for analyzing Satellite-2 imagery to track vegetation recovery (NDVI) and flag anomalies (e.g., unexpected clearing in a recovering area).

### ERS (Evidence Reporting Service)
An internal service that aggregates data from DB, GEE, and Climate APIs to generate legally robust documents (PDFs) and evidence packages.

### Certificate hash
A cryptographic signature (SHA-256) added to every PDF certificate generated by ForestGuard. This allows anyone to verify that the document has not been tampered with by scanning the QR code or checking the hash against the API.

### Protected area
Legally designated land (National Parks, Reserves) where human activity is restricted. Fires in these areas trigger special high-priority alerts and permanent change-of-use prohibitions.
